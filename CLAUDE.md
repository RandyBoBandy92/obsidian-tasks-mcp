# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Obsidian Tasks integration with Claude AI. The server extracts and queries Obsidian-formatted tasks from markdown files, enabling AI-assisted task management. It provides three main MCP tools: `list_all_tasks`, `query_tasks`, and `complete_task`.

## Common Commands

### Development
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to dist/)
- `npm run watch` - Compile TypeScript in watch mode for development
- `npm run prepare` - Build the project (runs automatically on npm install)

### Testing
- `npm test` - Run the full test suite using Jest
- `NODE_ENV=test npm test` - Run tests with explicit test environment

### Running the Server
- `node dist/src/index.js /path/to/vault` - Run the compiled MCP server
- `npx @jfim/obsidian-tasks-mcp /path/to/vault` - Run via npm package

## Architecture

### Core Components

**src/index.ts** - Main MCP server entry point
- Sets up MCP server with stdio transport
- Handles command-line argument parsing for vault directories
- Implements security validation for path traversal protection
- Exports three main tool handlers: `handleListAllTasksRequest`, `handleQueryTasksRequest`, and `handleCompleteTaskRequest`
- Uses glob patterns to find markdown files recursively

**src/TaskParser.ts** - Task parsing and querying engine
- `Task` interface defines the structure for task objects with metadata (status, dates, tags, priority)
- `TaskRegex` class contains all regex patterns for parsing Obsidian Tasks format
- `parseTasks()` and `parseTaskLine()` extract tasks from markdown content
- `queryTasks()` and `applyFilter()` implement the query filtering system
- `completeTask()` marks tasks as complete by updating markdown files directly
- Supports complex query syntax with AND/OR logic and various filter types

### Task Format Support
The parser recognizes standard Obsidian Tasks syntax:
- Status symbols: `[ ]` (incomplete), `[x]` (complete), `[-]` (cancelled), `[/]` (in progress)
- Date emojis: üìÖüóìÔ∏è (due), ‚è≥ (scheduled), üõ´ (start), ‚ûï (created)
- Priority emojis: ‚è´‚è´ (highest), ‚è´ (high), üîº (medium), üîΩ (low), ‚è¨ (lowest)
- Tags: `#tag` format
- Recurrence: üîÅ patterns

### Urgency Calculation
Implements the official Obsidian Tasks urgency formula:
- **Due Date Score**: Overdue tasks (12.0) down to future tasks (2.4+), with precise daily decrements
- **Priority Score**: Highest (9.0), High (6.0), Medium (3.9), None (1.95), Low (0.0), Lowest (-1.8)
- **Scheduled Date Score**: Today/earlier (5.0), Tomorrow/later (0.0)
- **Start Date Score**: Today/earlier (0.0), Tomorrow/later (-3.0)
- Final urgency = sum of all component scores
- Tasks without any metadata default to urgency score of 1.95

### Query System
Supports filtering by:
- Status: `done`, `not done`, `cancelled`, `in progress`
- Dates: `due today`, `due before 2024-01-01`, `has due date`, `no due date`
- Tags: `has tags`, `no tags`, `tag includes #work`, `has tag #specific`
- Path: `path includes folder`, `path does not include Silver Icing` (excludes subdirectories)
- Description: `description includes keyword`
- Priority: `priority is high`, `priority is none`
- Urgency: `urgency above 10`, `urgency below 5`, `urgency is 8.8`

### Boolean Operators
Supports case-sensitive boolean logic:
- `filter1 AND filter2` - Both conditions must match
- `filter1 OR filter2` - Either condition can match  
- `NOT filter` - Negates the filter condition
- Example: `(priority is high OR priority is medium) AND not done`

### Sorting System
Supports sorting by:
- `sort by urgency` - Sort by urgency score descending (highest first)
- `sort by urgency reverse` - Sort by urgency score ascending (lowest first)
- Default behavior: Sorts by urgency descending when no sort command specified

### Response Management
- **Automatic truncation**: Large responses are automatically truncated to stay under token limits
- **Truncation notice**: When truncated, shows count of hidden results and suggests more specific filters
- **Token estimation**: Provides accurate token count estimates in debug logs

### Security Features
- Path traversal protection prevents `..` in relative paths
- All paths resolved and validated against vault directory
- Symlink validation ensures targets stay within allowed directories

### Testing Architecture
- Jest-based test suite with ES modules support
- Test environment uses `NODE_ENV=test` to disable server startup
- Test vault in `tests/test-vault/` with sample markdown files
- Separate test files for different functionality areas:
  - `task-extraction.test.ts` - File parsing
  - `task-parsing.test.ts` - Task parsing logic
  - `task-query.test.ts` - Query filtering
  - `mcp-tools.test.ts` - MCP tool handlers

## Debugging

### Debug Logging
The MCP server writes debug logs to help troubleshoot query processing:

**File Logging**: Debug logs are written to `/tmp/obsidian-mcp-debug.log`
```bash
# Monitor debug logs in real-time
tail -f /tmp/obsidian-mcp-debug.log
```

**Log Contents**:
- Query received and parsed
- Path being scanned
- Total tasks found in directory
- Tasks remaining after filtering
- Response size and token estimates
- Truncation information when responses are too large

**Stderr Logging**: Debug information is also sent to stderr (may be captured by Claude Code/Desktop)

### MCP Inspector
For interactive debugging, use the official MCP Inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js /path/to/vault
```

This provides a visual interface to test MCP tools and see all debug output.

## Development Notes

### TypeScript Configuration
- Uses NodeNext module resolution for ESM compatibility
- Outputs to `dist/` directory with executable permissions
- Excludes any `obsidian-tasks/` directories from compilation

### Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP protocol implementation
- `chrono-node`, `moment` - Date parsing and manipulation
- `glob` - File pattern matching for markdown discovery
- `minimatch` - Path pattern matching
- `obsidian` - Type definitions (dev dependency)

### Project Structure
- Minimal two-file architecture: main server + task parser
- Exported functions allow direct testing without MCP protocol overhead
- Docker support available with volume mounting for vault access
